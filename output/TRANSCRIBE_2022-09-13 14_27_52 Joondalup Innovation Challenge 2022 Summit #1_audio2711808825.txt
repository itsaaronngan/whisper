So to start off, just type in yes in the chat if you have watched the videos about the business model canvas. Type in yes in the chat or if you're on camera just give me a thumbs up. Raul has, Ryan has, great thank you. Lydia has, great. Rahul, Kiran, Javan, have you jumped in and done this yet? Just type in yes if you have or no if you haven't. Like it's not a problem, we've still got them available. So we're going to look at the business model canvas and to do this I'm going to start looking at the problem space first. So like I just said we're going to look at the problem first. So you know Lydia, Raul, Ryan, I can see you're responding for the others. I hope that you're listening but if not just kind of listen in. I want you to type into the chat and this is a guess to start off with. This is just a guess okay and what I want you to guess is you know what's a problem? Not the problem, what's a problem? So any problem, there might be more. What's a problem that you're really looking at or that you can see in this space already? And I acknowledge you might not have spent much time researching it so just go with what you've got for now. This is where we're starting from. We are starting from right here. So what is a problem that you can see in the space? I feel free to shout out as well while you're on mute so feel free to shout out. Yeah so when you say the problem in the space, I think that trends that would be worth looking at would be health and well-being and the economy as a response to the COVID pandemic. Yeah okay great and what's your specific theme Raoul? I haven't got it off the top of my head. That's okay. Ryan, how about you? Francis? Doing smart cities and focusing on the second challenge question which I think is making better use of existing infrastructure to improve well a few aspects but yeah kind of like those three you're talking about. So managing the environmental, social and the actual economic performance with the design solution. Great okay great. So Raoul, Lydia everyone who's here is it okay if we just use Ryan's just and Raoul you did have a chance but you didn't have it at the tip of your tongue so is it okay for this one we're going to go with that space which Ryan has and I'm going to use it to really dive in deep to the business model canvas okay so Ryan smart cities and what was the challenge question specifically? It's the second one can't remember the exact wording but it's to do with managing the existing or using an existing infrastructure to improve performance overall. Okay great now so we can see the business model canvas here and if we have a look you know in JIC you would have seen this in a number of your places we're focusing on just a couple of those segments okay which do still give a big picture so you know what's the customer segment and what's the value proposition okay and today we're going to bounce back and forth a bit just to start teasing it out to start getting some detail. So as we do this just can you confirm that you can see my web browser? Okay great. So this is a piece of software called Mural now it's free to use for five things now don't go look it up yet because I'm going to give it to you afterwards don't go look it up yet I know some of you wanting to do that but I'm just going to show you literally from scratch what I do so like I'm just going to create a mural and I'm going to go to a template I'm going to search for the template business model canvas and there's the business model canvas now you'll see that there's a couple of other ones there we are using the business model canvas here but you know Mural has a lot of these available so anytime you want to have a play these are all there it's all free to use and you pay if you want to have some of the fancy features not sponsored but I think this is pretty great. So I'm going to create a new Mural literally as simple as this and now we've got this space and we've got all of these little segment poster notes things you can zoom in you can zoom out and you can add text and things off to the side here so what I'm going to do first of all is you know just create add a title and the title I'm going to create is you know smart cities making use of existing resources now as you can see I'm really not focusing too much about making it super pretty again I'm just not making it super pretty so making use of existing resources and there was more in that Ryan wasn't there now Ryan what's a problem or challenge that you see in the current space? Well a big one because we're kind of focusing on getting cars off the road and not spending a lot of money doing it and basically trying to reduce drive time for people in general also for people who you know like for instance recently OverEast have put in massive public infrastructure for public transport for nurses when they're at the end of their shift but it's completely inappropriate as a solution for them because they finish their shift at like two or three in the morning and it's yeah that doesn't sort of manage the security and safety aspect so we're trying to manage these different things so reduce drive time improve people's feeling of safety and yeah okay so I've just got it all here now for everybody I want you to are we going to start looking at the customer segments first and first thing we're going to do is have a look at okay what are the customer segments that could be involved here so just type in the chat or just shout out and unmute shout out or not and unmute is going to be a bit quicker so just call it out might be good but what are some of those segments so we've already said nurses okay I'm just going to steal that one from what Ryan said well what can you see or Lydia or Francis what can you see might be another customer segment that might care about driving safely transport the buses and trains yeah okay so the buses and trains trains okay good students thanks Lydia great students students elderly people so right now you can see elderly people people with disabilities great you can see that I'm just going out and scanning it now these are all kind of with the exception of buses and trains these are all kind of individual groups now does anyone else care who else cares about this who else cares about getting people off the roads and also getting people home safely who else cares probably the cops and policymakers I'd say okay good anyone else and cops for our international friends are police yeah okay emergency services especially if they have to deal with the safety aspects afterwards so that's kind of cops I'm just going to add that there okay so now just a quick vote so this isn't going to be directly what you're working online because we're going to take it where the team wants so either Lydia or Raul can you just pick one or two focus groups in these customer segments that we want to focus on yeah let's focus on the students students okay great and Lydia anything that you want to add to that students and anyone else could do emergency services great okay good students and emergency services so we're going to specifically look at these two segments now right now this is all brainstorm okay it's all brainstorm now as we start to look at this you know I'm going to go back to the slides as we start to look at our customer segments we want to start getting really specific okay so you want to start having a look at okay what are some of those metrics that would be relevant for the students so when we talk about students are we talking high school university or post postgraduate just say one yeah at the very least people driving so like uni plus okay so now we're talking uni plus uni plus okay great and in terms of emergency services which specific emergency services are going to care the most ambulance yep St. John Ambulance or the ambulance service I love that by the way St. John Ambulance funds the Western Australia ambulance service because I've been a member for 10 years here in New South Wales very different but I'm very cool St. John Ambulance okay great so now we're starting to look at that what are some let's just imagine that okay we're solving of this problem of you know the safe a safe return home sorry this is gonna be a bit messy for for these people in the value proposition what are some rapid quick ideas that you might see that would make a difference if you start to combine these things together anyone don't worry about shouting out wrong answers just do you mean the value of well what so this is what you the value proposition is ultimately what is your idea what's your solution what are you giving to them so I might say so I'm gonna pick something different just so I don't overlap with this exercise right so if I'm looking at you know people with disabilities and or let's say I'm gonna look at nurses and the trains and buses okay I'm looking at nurses trains and buses I might say look a value proposition is hey how could we create I don't know a way that supports nurses and people who have shifts which finish at very late hours getting safely to the thing get safely to the place Francis has got one okay what if we created an electronic beacon or finder that has a proactive safety measure so instead of saying I've got to click something to react it's like hey the moment I do something else the moment something happens kind of like a forward detection monitor maybe that triggers a response or people with disabilities or elderly might have that for detection thing built-in right and specific segments in there to put the resources which are available fine into that space so if we're looking at university students also who else cares about university students universities yeah universities care about it study Perth cares about it especially where the there's international and there's a whole bunch of people that start caring okay so what could we start to look at that would make a difference here just throw some brainstorm ideas into the zoom chat I think it would be helpful to replace a like how you have the transport card and put it as like a digital wallet application so it's having to like live in your bag for a card you've just got it like PayPal so you can just click your ID good okay anything else thanks Lydia Wow well I think yeah this is this is a hard one because I haven't had a really good think about it but I guess I'm getting people safely home is that is that basically yeah yep yeah um maybe for me as a parent as well like if I had some sort of integration with like my child getting been able to get home safely like I know that they they clocked on and you know roughly when they should be arriving home that could be helpful for parents okay great you know with you know that students are going out and studying stuff yeah okay and it's fine anything else I guess if you wanted to take like a train station as an example so something Kelly Cunningham was looking at was smart LEDs and CCTV to improve security in public spaces so if you have smart LEDs that are actively lighting up an area but not using as much power as big massive lights constantly being on that might be a good way to provide a little bit more safety yeah okay great so perfect so I know we've got not much time but if you start to have a look we don't we've got a number of ideas which are we're clear aren't yet the full idea but now you start looking at security stations of smart lighting we're starting to add another customer segment now that's the train stations or now that's the local government who funds that now that we start to linking to kept parents and carers we're like ah hold on that might be another customer segment it's another person who cares about that end user in this case a university student getting where they need to be safely and unharmed so first of all I just want to check in type in yes in the chat or just unmute and give me a thumbs up or give me a thumbs up and if you can start to see that as you start bouncing between the ideas and just let it happen letting it happen not worrying about getting it perfect if you can see that hey actually things start to pop up it's like oh here's another idea oh here's another idea yeah well thanks for the digital thumbs up Brian great Lydia yes in the chat perfect so this is what we want you to start looking at Kiran up great to have you here Karan was worried for a bit we want to start diving into that okay now one of the homework items or homework tasks after the orientation was start to get evidence for your problem so in this case the evidence which you would start to get is okay how many people are getting home or finishing work late how many university students experiencing trouble or difficulty getting home or they're getting home but they're not feeling safe or doing that so how many people what's that like are there statistics on injuries or emergency services call outs after or between specific periods of time what types of customers have you identified and we've started to do some of that here okay now as we go through when you look at your video in live pitch you want at least one customer or user segment right and that persona should be very detailed now the value proposition which ultimately the solution just notice that what we've been doing so far is we've been doing it as a brainstorm and it's not fixed but you can cut kind of start to picture hey if we started to mash these things together that would be an interesting idea right that would be nice and you'd probably get some efficiencies there and you'd probably get a couple of different things in that space which is like oh that's a new idea so ultimately what we want to leave you with from this master class is start doing the work and don't worry about getting it perfect okay don't worry about getting it perfect because that getting it perfect is going to stop you from making progress right now it's appropriate that you haven't got anything figured out yet it's actually appropriate because you haven't gone through the structure yet so instead of worrying about I haven't got it it's not going to work there's not much time tomorrow's less than what less than 20 hours away don't worry about that just yet to start thinking okay where can I start to sit with exploring the problem and there's two fundamental ways that you can approach the business model canvas as you start to explore what you're going to do and one of them is what most people do is like oh here's a solution my business model canvas represents my solution ok now you should eventually get to that but what I'm inviting you to look at first is start to look at okay how does my business model canvas help me to explore the situation to explore what's going on ok in a moment when we get back into the zoom chat going to ask people what you got feel free to type what you're learning from this session in that main chat ok
