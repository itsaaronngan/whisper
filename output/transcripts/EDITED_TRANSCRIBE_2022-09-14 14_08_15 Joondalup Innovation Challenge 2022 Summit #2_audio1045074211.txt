You could do all of that sort of stuff. And then you've got Fiverr to do marketing logos, probably for 20 bucks. Get four products. True, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, if you start to have, you know, by the way, who's a group of people that has a bunch of these random skills that you could employ to do some of these jobs? The students themselves, that's right. Yeah, okay. So now we're starting to kind of create something that takes place. Like, a bit like a movement that you're creating. You're like, "Hey, postgraduate students, we get the struggle that it takes to really... This might be some kind of what might turn into a viral campaign. I've got a problem with... Well, it's difficult to create campaigns with the view of going viral. Because now you're kind of like flapping in the wind. And if the wind shifts even just a little bit, you kind of, the flag that flies really strongly with the wind is now just kind of like flying like a bedraggled... Sort of, there's a possum hanging onto the pole, right? And so, you might then create, say, "Okay, you know, hey, we get this challenge. We're looking to create this community where people can come together, they can get resources, and we're connecting these things together. And there's a bunch of creative admin skills that we want to do, and we don't want to go anywhere else to get it because we know the skills are here. Who wants to put their hand up, do some paid work to create this, and be a part of making this solution available?" Okay, so now you're actually kind of, and by the way, is, you know what we call, like, experience? I was going to say that actually, it's part of their experience, just making this. So if that's what they've learned, so yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right. And by the way, you could probably get some funding from different businesses to make this happen as well and pay for that initial setup if you can guarantee a set of people coming through. Okay, so now that's our revenue, our costs, right? So the costs are there, right? So $200 for the website, what would that look like, something basic but flashy? You spend the money, spend another $500 or so on the design, you spend another $500 or so on whatever, maybe you pay someone $50 an hour, sorry, maybe too much, pay someone $30 an hour, $25 an hour. So whatever the standard hourly wage is for like 3 to 5 hours, for 1 to 2 hours a day, and their job for that 1 to 2 hours is to reach out to people, connect with people, build people, like bring people to the community group, do you know what I mean? Their metric, because there are jobs out there now called community managers and online community managers. Okay, so now as we start to go through the slide, I'm also keeping an eye on the time. There's other things like, yeah, you might have employees eventually, but for the start, you might not. Hey, who else might you get to review those resumes? Who else is out there? So we're getting that this is quite lean. And here's where I'm going with quite lean. Is that you want to have the if I had lots of money solution, and then also hold in your head at the same time, what's the I've got very little money or I've got $100 to $300 bucks version. Because that $100 to $300 bucks version is going to be miles ahead of the zero dollars version, but it's also going to be something which is way less complex than the $5,000 dollars version. Okay, and now we're kind of diving into the actual operational business side of it. Like if you were to start this up, if you had to go and hustle for that $50,000 dollars, which you're limited by yourselves, do you get that? You would automatically kind of limit this. At the moment, it kind of feels like, "Hey, what if we just gave you $50,000 dollars?" But this putting this into your plans is going to be powerful because then you can start going, "Okay, you know..."
