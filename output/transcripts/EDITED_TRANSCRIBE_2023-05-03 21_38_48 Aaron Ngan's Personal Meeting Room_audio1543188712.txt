All right. Hello, everyone. This is my Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) mission three for the rapid self-employment. So this has been one of the, I guess, probably the biggest missions for me. I think this is in the culmination of a bunch of things which I've been wanting to do. 

And so one of the things I am is I'm a public speaking coach. I approach people on speaking, pitching, expressing themselves. 

And I went into this mission not necessarily wanting to go down that path. I looked, but I was like, I'm curious. I'm going to check out what is there in terms of logs, in terms of medium content books, low content books, logs for public speaking. So first of all, public speaking is one of the biggest topics out there. 

There's only one other journal or log out there. And I'm actually, I've got Amazon Prime. So I've got Kindle Unlimited. And that book was actually there. So I went in to have a look. And as I'm thinking through, this is something which has been created, I think, two, three years ago. There's text all over the page. There's not much space for people to actually put their content in, like in the example. So I was like, this is interesting. 

What I did take away from it was, you know, like there's this initial sort of explainer. There's this initial sort of content. I'm like, wow, okay. You know, this is pretty great. So this is how I went about kind of creating it. And I think for this one, I had the idea from when we first had the workshop. I'm like, you know, this is going to be something I'm keen to explore. It's something which I do a lot of. I can promote through the events that I run. There's a lot of different opportunities. 

In fact, tonight, I was at a University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) public speaking societies competition. And I actually remembered to mention to someone at the end, you know, like, hey, this is what I'm doing. I'm going to be, yeah, like the night's not over. I'm going to go home. I'm going to upload this to Amazon. And the person was like, oh, that's really cool. Can I buy the book? So we'll see if that happens right away. But I am keen to take you through the whole process. 

Now, initially, this started off as this grand idea of, you know, people struggle when they're preparing a presentation. They're faced with this blank page. What do I write? And I really wanted to kind of shake that up a bit as well and go, you know, sitting down at a desk, sitting down in front of a page, writing out start to finish a script, just like writing out a report start to finish, just like writing out any document start to finish isn't really efficient, but it's what most people do. 

So I had this grand idea of going, okay, what if I create something that's going to guide them through the whole process? They're going to have conversations with people. They're going to find out what other people get excited about, what they're clear about. The more conversations they have, it's going to get clearer for them. It's going to be great. And if this sounds muddled, yeah, it was. I'll take you through the process. 

You know, I started off here in my notion. I was like, I'm going to draft it. I was like, okay, you know, what's this concept? Okay. So a workbook to assist people in preparing the upcoming talks, pitches, presentations, whatever. Key theme, you know, build it through conversation. Like what if every conversation that you had was an opportunity to go out and develop your content, to develop what you want to say.
