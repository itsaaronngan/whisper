All right, from the transcript, the necessary transformations are as follows:

RSC transformed into RSC
WSU transformed into Western Sydney University (WSU)
Fujitsu transformed into Fujitsu
Meebo transformed into Meebo
UNSW transformed into University of New South Wales (UNSW)
UTS transformed into University of Technology Sydney (UTS)
STEM transformed into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)

Generally, the names that are not acronyms such as Alpha, AusLeap, Sarah Gatehouse were not transformed. The transcript also contained everyday words which were not transformed. 

Unknown Acronyms:
RSC
Meebo
This could be specific terminology related to the entities involved in the conversation and therefore they were kept as is. However, more information is needed to identify the correct full names. There are no acronyms or specialized terms to transform in this context. The text seems to be a part of a general conversation about workshops, presentations, and events. The only capitalized terms are company names, which are not acronyms (Transformed, STEM, NG, UNSW, UTS, UCED, SLP). Names that are not acronyms should not be transformed. The transcript mentions two acronyms: "STEM" and "SLP". The first should be corrected to "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)" and the second to "Speech-Language Pathology (SLP)" unless it is specified to have a different meaning in the context.

Here are the transformations:
- STEM transformed into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
- SLP transformed into Speech-Language Pathology (SLP)

Please note, SLP is a common abbreviation for Speech-Language Pathology, however, within your context it may represent a different term. Please provide the full form if it differs. There doesn't seem to be any acronyms or specialised terms that need to be formatted in this text. The transcript seems to be informal conversation regarding regular meetings and plans without using any specific professional or institutional terms.

Transformations made: None.
Unknown acronyms: None. Transcript:

fortnight.

Yeah, sure. But there might be opportunities to go, okay, cool, we're going to run a series of them. One's going to be at University of Technology Sydney (UTS), one's going to be at University of New South Wales (UNSW), one's going to be at McCoy or we just do one, everyone shows up, whatever.

The more of those that I do, the better. And these would be free workshops for the participants. They get some really good skills, all that sort of stuff.

Yeah, okay. Yeah, that sounds amazing. I'll let my team know. We'll get back to you as well.

Awesome, awesome.

Okay, great, sounds good, appreciate it.

Okay, great, have a good week then. We'll catch up in a fortnight.

Will do, all right, bye. Thanks.

List of Transformations:

1) 'UTS' transformed into 'University of Technology Sydney (UTS)'
2) 'UNSW' transformed into 'University of New South Wales (UNSW)'

Title: "Planning Free Educational Workshops at Various Universities"

Summary: The meeting transcript discusses the planning of a series of free workshops to be held at different universities including the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and the University of New South Wales (UNSW). The aim of these workshops is to provide participants with valuable skills. The team will reconvene in a fortnight to discuss further details.

Key Learnings/Topics Discussed:
1. Planning of free workshops
2. Hosting workshops at different universities (UTS, UNSW)
3. Skill development for participants

Suggestions for Packaged Content:
1. Create a template for a workshop planning guide, including details on how to choose locations, plan content, and engage participants.
2. Develop an informational brochure or webpage about the workshops, highlighting the benefits of participation and the skills that can be gained.
3. Create a series of blog posts or articles sharing insights from the workshops, potentially featuring participant testimonials or case studies.
