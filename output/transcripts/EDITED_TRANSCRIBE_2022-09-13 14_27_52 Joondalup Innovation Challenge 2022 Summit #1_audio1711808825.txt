Why don't we kick off? People might still be filtering in, but we can kick off, yeah. If it's okay, I'm going to share my screen and to kick us off with a quick video from the city. We call it the Why Joondalup video, and it's something that we use quite often for when we're speaking to an audience, particularly an international audience.

This is about really showcasing what we've got to offer in Joondalup in terms of tourism and destination, but also from the perspective of investment and what we can offer in terms of technology for startups and businesses and bigger corporate companies as well to come and invest in Joondalup. I'll share that with you, and if we've got time, I've got another one that I'll share towards the end, but let me just do this. Can you see that presentation? It's one place in Australia.

One sec. All good? Yeah. We're seeing the whole slide, but I think it's fine. And smart growth, where you can find global talent and a diverse supply chain, a place that's becoming known as the capital of cyber. Welcome to the city of Joondalup. Welcome to Joondalup. Be a part of the global community. Now is the time. Connect with your future.

There's one. There's one. Sorry, let me just get away from that slide so it doesn't keep playing. I wanted to go through, before we get into the challenge themes, just a little bit of context around where we're at in terms of innovation, and I guess explaining our role within innovation as a way of giving some background to why the city has created this challenge with the Frank team. I think James, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), did mention this earlier today that we have very limited space in Joondalup, particularly in comparison to our neighboring local governments, the city of Stirling and the city of Wanaroo, who have quite a lot of development space still ongoing and have a lot of population growth predicted in their future.

In the city, we have the ocean on one side, the city of Wanaroo on the other, and above us. So we're very much at capacity almost in terms of our population. So as a result of that, entrepreneurship is really a key driver of our business culture. We're home to over 10,000 micro businesses, so very small home-based businesses, and programs like the Innovation Challenge are very much a part of how we hope to bolster that future workforce that is both entrepreneurial and employable.

The city is committed to supporting innovation in the digital economy, and again, James did mention this in his presentation earlier, but just last month at our August council meeting, the city of Joondalup council voted to support some real exciting innovative development areas, looking really at business and innovation precincts, understanding how to grow our startup culture, looking at funding opportunities and programming and partnerships. So that's really going to catalyze a lot of the economic and innovation growth that we see in the future years.

We're actually about to embark on a revision of our economic development strategy, which is what guides our activities in this space, and I think innovation is coming through from our business community as a really clear focus area for future development of the economy. I'll just quickly touch on technology and cyber. I know that that's part of one of our theme areas, but it's also one of the core focus areas for me in my role and for the whole team as we deliver that economic development strategy.

We consider ourselves to be a prime location across that investment industry development for the knowledge economy. So we've got health, medical, education, training, cybersecurity, and again, we'll talk about this a bit more once we get into the themes themselves, but anything related to that 4.0 technologies, automation, robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, defense, tourism, and retail. So there's a lot in there. There's a lot of what we've already got in Joondalup, but it's about elevating those emerging technologies as a way of driving some of this industry development.

Transformations:
1. 'AI' transformed into 'Artificial Intelligence (AI)'
2. 'CEO' transformed into 'Chief Executive Officer (CEO)'
3. 'Big Data' transformed into 'Big Data'
 In terms of the skill shortages, it's probably no surprise to the people in this breakout room that we're going to be looking at something like 18,000 skilled cyber workers needed in Australia alone.

Joondalup is one of the largest outputs of cyber security (CS) graduates nationally. So that's something that we really want to focus on, making sure that there's an industry for those graduates, but also in really trying to increase that pipeline of students working with schools and the tertiary sector as well to really bolster the amount of interest that's coming into this sector.

So we'll get into the challenge themes. So theme three is revitalizing the Visitor Economy (VE). This is one that's kind of been on the board for the last few years for obvious reasons. We have had some significant impacts to the VE as a result of COVID-19. So it's really exposed how much national and local economies rely on visitors.

In comparison to Australia as a whole, the city is actually more reliant on the visitor related industries as a proportion of the whole economy. So when you look at it that way, it's based on the range of sectors that we have, but we're actually more susceptible to those fluctuations. So as a result, we're really focused on how we can support the survival of visitor related businesses in the short term, as well as building a strong foundation for long term resilience and growth.

In 2020, we launched the Destination City Plan (DCP), which is this five year strategy that the city will deliver to grow the VE. When we talk about the VE, we're not just talking about tourism. We're really looking at the broader destination and visitors. So we're talking about education visitors. We're talking about Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) of our students. We're talking about people coming from within and outside of Western Australia (WA) to use our hospital campuses to use medical services, not to mention, you know, retail and hospitality and obviously tourism.

Tourism is a significant focus area for us. Hillary's Boat Harbour is the second most visited precinct or place in WA, behind Kings Park, I believe. And that's in our patch, so that's very much part of as we support that precinct and making sure that we're getting holidaymakers and international visitors back into Perth and making sure that Joondalup is getting that market share. Hillary's Boat Harbour is a big part of how we position ourselves in that space.

So I mentioned the VFR and holiday seekers, the key drivers for leisure visitation to Joondalup in the city's three tourism sectors. So we've got Overnight International Trips (OIT), Domestic Overnight Trips (DOT), and Domestic Day Trips (DDT). A strong appeal in the VFR market is very much attributed to the region's significant expatriate population. I don't know whether you'll be able to tell from my accent, but I'm actually originally from the UK and I live in Joondalup. And there's a lot of people from our main kind of expatriate locations, which are the UK, South Africa, and India. Those are the top three significant countries of origin for our community. So friends and family of those people are a significant target audience for tourism activities.

In terms of education, we are home to a variety of primary schools, secondary schools, tertiary and vocational education institutions that attract both domestic and international students and visitors. So obviously, we've mentioned Edith Cowan University (ECU) and North Metropolitan TAFE (NMT). We have the Western Australia (WA) Police Academy, the College of Electrical Training, the AMA College. We are also home to a number of significant Registered Training Organisations (RTOs). And I think the core thing for us in terms of our DCP is that education is really a driver of visitors to Australia. International students are not only visitors themselves, but they attract visitation from their family and friends. Our latest data shows that for every one international student, sorry, one in every four people that visited Australia...

11. 'Registered Training Organisations' transformed into 'Registered Training Organisations (RTOs)'. around establishing an innovation center. We have an innovation fund. We have an ecosystem. But there's much more to be done. And we're very interested in your ideas about that. 

So we've got one final theme. And this is relating to our climate change adaptation and resilience plan. 

Now the city of Joondalup is very committed to enhancing the environmental sustainability of the city by managing and reducing its impacts on the environment. The city's strategic community plan sets a very strong framework for this. Theme five, inclusive community, safe and healthy community, environmentally responsible. And it's something that we're continuing to build on.

And at an operational level, there's a lot of progress being made. We are currently working on an urban forest strategy. We've got a waste management three-year plan. And we've put out a green house gas emissions reduction plan. And you'll see we've just added our new climate change adaptation and resilience plan.

So there's a lot of work being done in this space. But there are many areas where Joondalup is vulnerable to climate change. And we need to protect our community from the impacts of climate change, whether they're physical or socio-economic in nature, and we need to really ensure we're facilitating resilience to those.

So here, we're interested in your ideas. How could the city improve its own environmental practices? For instance, how might we reduce the city's green house gas emissions from its buildings, vehicle fleet, or street lighting? How could we improve the city's water efficiency? What other impact areas should be considered?

So there's some, a lot of ideas there for you, and I'm very interested to hear yours as we move into the group discussions.
