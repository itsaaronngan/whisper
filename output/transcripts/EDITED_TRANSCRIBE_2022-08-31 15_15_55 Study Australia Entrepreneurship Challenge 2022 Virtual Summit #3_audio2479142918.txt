Sir, when we are giving for a solution based on Warehouse Management System (WMS), and Warehouse Control System (WCS), we need to have engineering background. We need to have the cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions which will be given more specifically into engineering and technology for today's world. We are going to work on real-time problems and solutions for real-time scenarios in today's world. 

Absolutely, because, and for everyone, you can really get that when you get a feature to a certain level. Now, not always, but especially in a technically focused world with highly specialized processes and highly specialized techniques, just like in warehouse management, where time, storage space, efficiency, the amount of the duration in which you can have something stored in the warehouse, all of that is highly specialized. 

Okay, thank you. And can everyone see that, the sales, trade shows, the networking, engineering as marketing, those were the ones that appeared to be most important.

Platforms, including existing gaming platforms, perhaps. Yep. 

Which is your name? Srinath or Abhinav? Which one are you? I know there's two of you. 

Srinath. Okay. Got it. Yep. I can see you nodding. Thank you. 

Social and display advertisements. A couple of times. Perfect. 

Online advertisements. Perfect. Because a lot of the time when we're gaming, we're either in front of a console or we're on a computer and we're well-placed to receive those advertisements. 

Potentially affiliate marketing with well-known gamers, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and also potentially the influencer side of things, unconventional public relations, things like that as well. Okay, great. And we'll do one more. Let's have a look at which one? Small businesses. 

So we've got two small business targets. We've got one for visualizing data and the other one for digital marketing. So let's have a look at those together. What are some channels that you might use for small businesses? Go ahead and type into the Zoom chat. What would you use for a small business? 

SEO. Great. 

Content marketing. Okay. What else are we thinking? 

Yep. Search Engine Marketing (SEM). Great. Anything else? Yeah. 

Public Relations (PR). Some trade shows and exhibitions, depending on the industry that the market that the company is in. Absolutely. Target market blogs. 

Now, something to consider when you're thinking about small businesses as distinct from medium-sized and larger businesses is that is that smaller businesses have so much time on their hands, don't they? No, they don't. Because small businesses are a few people, small team, and they're doing literally everything, aren't they? They're handling the sales, they're handling the operations, they're busy creating the products. So that's just something to keep in mind. Do they have the time to actually go to the trade show? Sometimes, but only if it's important enough. Okay. So that's just something to consider. How much time do these people have, really? 

Okay. Now, as we go through in terms of the distribution channels, you want to start choosing the most cost effective. And as you start to look at things like advertising, PR, unconventional Public Relations (PR), start to do your research and make your -approximate guesses about how much is it going to cost. Especially if you're doing advertising, start thinking about what is a paid advertisement going to cost? What is a paid ad on Google going to cost? How much is it going to cost to do the work for the search engine management? 

Now, here's where it can sometimes be tempting to say, we're going to do everything for free. Search Engine Optimization (SEO), we'll do it ourselves for free. Or Public Relations (PR), we're going to do something crazy and it's going to go viral. What I would invite you to consider is that most viral campaigns, especially by large companies, actually take a lot of work. So actually consider that it does cost some money. And a place to start for your idea might be to limit, to still put some money into paid advertising if it makes sense, if it makes sense. But start small, maybe start $500, $100, $1,000, something like that. So that you can actually test it. You can actually experiment. Because inside of your plan, now on the pitch night, in the finals, you'll have the chance to ask questions. And sometimes they might ask you a question you don't know the answer to. But what you can do is say, hey, based on our plan, and based on the results from our initial trials, from our initial launch there are no transformed acronyms in this text.
 two hours, three hours. So, for each hour it varies. That's your variable cost.

Now, variable costs are important, why? Because if your variable costs become too high, as you start to increase the number of clients or your revenue, your costs increase, and maybe even more so, the proportion of the costs compared to your revenue. And that's where, the term Profit and Loss account, or P&L comes in.

Understanding the relationship between your variable and fixed costs helps you manage your P&L better, if you don't, you might end up, before you know it, in a situation where you're running out of cash, or even worse, going into debt, which we don't want.

So, having a good understanding of your Costs of Goods Sold or COGS, your internal costs, like office rent, and your variable costs helps you keep things balanced.
