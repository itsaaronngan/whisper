do that. We're recording the session now and we're in the breakout room and look for this masterclass you're starting to see that you have so many different topics and different themes and as we go through these tools these techniques you'll see them in action for yourself but you'll also see them in action for other groups and other teams so when you walk out of the interchange program having fully completed everything that there is to complete you'll have your own individual experience and everything that you've learned by doing the work you'll also have an extremely broad sense of wow this is what's possible in all these different fields okay all these different fields which is which is pretty cool okay so i want everyone to consider that especially if you know people who are in other teams or you you've already started to connect with them on linkedin you started to kind of do that networking for these stages for these weeks really my my recommendation is don't you know sometimes in a competition you kind of are like i don't want to talk to them because what if they what if they steal my ideas or anything like that my invitation is actually build those networks like ask questions contribute we've already started to see it in some of those breakout rooms someone earlier um the person who um who came and won the won the award was like yeah like we're looking at the same topic um and i got some really great tips and that's going to be really powerful because when you build those connections and we contribute to each other that's going to be really the the gift that keeps them giving long after you've completed the program and as well like after a couple of years you'll forget whether or not you won or not or anything like that maybe you won't forget if you won but what's going to stay is the value that you get by building these connections and having these experiences regardless of the outcome okay wonderful so let's dive in let's dive in so firstly i want to throw up this slide which is what is entrepreneurship so just go ahead and type in the chat um what you think entrepreneurship is or specifically what comes to mind when you hear the word entrepreneurship what comes to mind we've got creating change great and no right or wrong answers this is just what you think when i'm looking for the right answer i'm just looking for what you think starting a business innovation challenging the norm absolutely solutions conceptualizing creativity oh that's an exciting one starting from scratch leading teams building the future i love it i love it leadership providing solutions great pushing boundaries business wonderful now i want to say i haven't seen a single thing here that i disagree with by the way so all of these things are are great okay now in terms of i'm just going to sort my slides out slightly just bear with me one moment now all of those things if you have a look at all of those things just type in yes in the chat if you can see hey a lot of those things even the ones that i didn't say actually all really do make sense just type in yes in the chat if like hey that makes sense all right so and by the way part of the reason why i'm constantly checking in to see if this makes sense is hey this is really powerful to get that there's so much value inside of what everyone's sharing so when you share you contribute to that and when you read and get present to hey this is what uh everyone else is seeing you're like wow like even in this moment that is making a difference for me okay which is for you specifically now entrepreneurship is really a mindset of problem solving okay problem solving so we're going to go through something called the business model canvas in a little bit but really the foundation is starting to really explore the problem which i know that all of you have done inside of the process of having your um having decided on your field okay that's the first step like first step in solving a problem is first you've got to pick a problem to solve and start to get narrowing in okay so deciding what problem to solve isn't worthy another place you can look at is do enough people care about this problem um sometimes there's problems which people don't know that it exists right don't know it's like you you hear those examples of people realizing like they get a medical diagnosis and it's horrible and then all of a sudden they realize wow all of these things which i've been doing that haven't really been contributing to my health actually they were a problem i didn't realize that they were but now i've got this diagnosis the doctors told me hey this is this is happening now and now you're like oh wow that's that's a problem okay now you'll see those different things and you also see a bunch of people who don't know it's a problem so entrepreneurship partially is sharing with people hey by the way we found this problem not a lot of people know it's a problem but it's impacting all these people check this out so you're educating people you're sharing and you're starting to broaden those boundaries type in makes sense make sense uh if that makes sense to you and if it doesn't you can say i don't know you can put a question mark if it doesn't make sense that's fine too so just type in make sense if it makes sense or type a question mark if if you're like oh it's a bit confused and by the way you'll notice that when i engage on zoom i'll do a lot of here say this one word i'm going to tell you right now in these master classes especially anytime that it's like you're not sure feel free to put a question mark so that i'm like okay cool that's not clear i'm not i don't need you to it's not it's not necessary that everyone disagrees all the time it's okay to question it's okay to ask what does that mean how do i apply that because that type of questioning is really powerful for your learning and exploration of this topic now as well type in actually no i'm not going to do that one of the things that we're going to look at as well is entrepreneurship a lot of people associate with starting a startup or creating a business yes now i want you to know that entrepreneurship is a skill it's important and it's valuable regardless of whether you're starting up a business in which case it's almost critical but it's also extremely valuable and important anywhere that you're working whether you work in a large company whether you work in a not-for-profit whether you're in a volunteer organization whatever it is that you're doing you can start to take these skills these tools these techniques and these mindsets and you can start to go wow okay how do we start to shift things how do we keep on start making that bigger difference and no longer the cb no longer the ceo cba former ceo um it's like hey if we don't successfully innovate um we're toast it's not going to go well right because the world keeps on going so if you stop then the world keeps on going and you're kind of left behind okay now if you're this is something to just be sitting with throughout the entire time is that you're in this program but also this is my invitation for you to sit with this question uh anywhere is how can i use entrepreneurial thinking within a job within my assignments uh within the projects within the things which i've got to do around the house like some of you have kids in your family uh whether they're yours or the you need to look after how are you going to innovate there how are you going to use entrepreneurial thinking within your society okay so that's something to just kind of sit there and just consider what could i bring what can i bring from this program into life and that's really a critical thing right because ultimately we don't want you to just have this experience of entrepreneurship in this environment yes we do want that but we don't want it to be limited to that because ultimately what's going to make a difference is that you get to take these skills and have it make a difference in your life where life happens which is university school classes family relationships work careers hobbies all of those things okay because that's where life is happening if you if you notice life isn't always just in classrooms life is everywhere okay now something to think about is that we are all building startups we're building these mini startup ideas so we want are we going to take on that hey within this interchange program we're building a startup and and your challenge is to to kind of go okay how can we solve this problem how do i create a business idea that creates a profit or makes a social impact in fact you have a look in everything that you've chosen and you'll probably see that all of those things that you've chosen you actually chose them because you want to make a difference in that area so type in impact just type in the word impact if you're like yes i do want to make a difference in that area and that's part of why i chose that focus area impact yeah absolutely now what we encourage you to do is yes we're making the impact and you also want to make sure that so to see how can we have this make a profit because without that profit it's not going to be sustainable okay it's not going to be sustainable and and this is really something which any business or any work or any job or any enterprise that you find yourself taking part in any cause whether it's work related or not related is starting to look from these multiple different places like okay how can we make a difference for people how can we make a difference in terms of finance and money making sure that we're actually able to keep this going and how can we make sure that this is something which is making a positive impact in the world okay now all of this by the way like i've mentioned before is being recorded so you can come back to this master class and get a sense of it but i am covering this quite quickly i am okay and because i want to to get through this content you can watch it back and you can start to go okay where is the people focus where is the planet focus where is the prosperity focus where is that present in my idea and you can take that apart as uh in your team so that you can start to kind of look at that for your pitches and for your ideas um but for now this is uh almost some reference foundation i'm going to dive in practically in a moment to the business model canvas um but before we do that like one of the things that we invite you to do is how can you use technology to enable what you're up to all right so on the screen here ai internet of things virtual reality augmented reality um these are just some basic like these are some of the fancier things of technology but if you have a look i want you to type into the zoom chat like what are some bits of technology that you actually use on a day-to-day basis that really makes a difference for your life maybe in the world of connection maybe in the world of getting things done what are some of those bits of technology that really make a difference in what you're out to accomplish so slack okay great what's up communication tools absolutely linkedin as a form of community google forms oh man google forms once you start to get into google forms and how you can get those uh responses automatically done you can start to do some fancy things with the google forms like it's this specific experience of like wow there's this magic of what i can create or when i don't know about any of you but if you've ever used a productivity tool and you've started to explore what's possible and you focus that in a project what starts to open up is like wow there's so much more i can do okay notion is one of those things so i run most of my business life in notion i've got different projects i've got different workshops i track how much money those make um and i'm like oh wow what if i track all these social gatherings and things that i do because i forget sometimes like what did i do last week i don't know if i don't keep track of it um who did i meet at that event i don't know um email facebook for me my calendar so you can see that all of these bits of technology zoom okay it's a perfect one your fitness watch garmin health tracking now i want you to get that each piece of technology that's in here really uh enables something okay it really enables something yeah alvina says notions amazing love it highly recommend it totally maybe create like a mini notion space for your group alvina and absolutely now so don't be intimidated by technology really just get that we use technology all the time it's there to service and to solve our problems and it's really an opportunity now something that's big picture as well right big picture for all of us is anytime that you're feeling stuck anytime that you're feeling like this isn't making sense or we're not working things out or why can't people see um is this big picture of growth mindset where things are not fixed okay you might feel hey this isn't possible you might feel i don't know if i can do this or someone's asked me to pitch or create the video i've never done that before well my invitation is to consider that your entire life whether you realize it or not you're actually growing and developing now a simple example is any of you five years ago did you imagine hey i might be participating in some kind of entrepreneurial challenge and pushing my boundaries in this particular way type in yes or no like five years ago hey would i be doing this or maybe yes like look look 10 years ago and notice wow i'm actually so much more capable now than five years ago in a way that i can't even describe okay just like nod for me if you can start to get that so are we going to get that you already have everything you need to grow and to develop now in the actual moment where we experience getting stuck it can sometimes not feel that way it can sometimes feel like what are you talking about what are you talking about i can't do this um no that's silly i'm not gonna i'm not gonna pitch you're gonna pitch i'm bad at pitching or whatever it might be okay so my invitation is actually go and find out now the only way that you go and find out is by doing it you're not going to find out by doing the research you're not going to find out by trying to figure it out you're not going to find out by doing anything other than taking some kind of action okay um last year and i'll recap i'll mention this again on on the on the next in two saturdays time last year we had one of the teams and i asked one of the like some of you have added me on linkedin and i if you did i would have asked you hey what's what are you excited for and just in these conversations and it's really great when i hear all of those different things which you share because it gets me connected to hey this is what you're up to these are the amazing people i'm i'm facilitating with and working with each and every one of you and one of these participants last year was like wow i started the day this is before the video deadline i started the day not knowing how to create videos and now i know how to create videos and put this together and do all that sort of stuff you had no idea and i was like okay what's possible now she's like oh like i've got all these other projects what if i create something here what if i bring people in what if i teach some people in my student society and she was just so lit up and so excited and that's what's possible and all possible because she was like well no one else is doing it i'm gonna do it she put her hand up okay so that's what the growth mindset piece is now final thing before we get into action is like your friend slash enemy in this program is time you realize that we don't have much time okay we don't have much time we've only got the next three or so weeks and then we've got the the video submission and then you've got to work at your pitch now in terms of time yeah like sometimes you can say hey like it would be great if we had more time and to that i'm going to say yeah that would be great maybe but we don't now what time really does help you is it helps you focus and like i said earlier on one of the biggest things you can do is go okay what do we have to look at now are there things that are going to come up next week or the week after in the content that we're just going to let it happen then now that's going to give you the space to actually focus on hey i don't have to worry about is this going to be a pitch right now which is going to be blowing everyone away i can just sit with okay what is the problem how do i explore it how do i build it all out and then as you build it out and as you take the actions things are going to align and open up as you go okay now we've got the business model canvas so there's nine different segments in a business model canvas but we're going to focus on just uh five of them okay now five of them it's going to be the the two cost ones what's the cost what's the revenue uh and we're going to look at the customer segments um i think key activities and value propositions but it's all going to come up now what i'm going to do is yeah so helia i got your question yes everyone will get this recording uh tomorrow okay specifically this recording so you guys are the the lucky highlight group okay so i'm going to show you a tool that um and that we that a lot of teams find success when creating uh their business model canvas okay uh we're not requiring you to use it you don't have to use it but i'm going to demonstrate it for you so that you can get hey like you know this will be pretty useful now i just want to check has anyone used awesome um it's okay it's on it's on it's on audio now for everyone to hear um now that was weird for me because i stopped sharing and then the audio just came out i was like did i do something then i don't think so um now just type in the chat has anyone experienced using mule before m u r a l just while i get it up has anyone used it before just type in yes if you have no a couple of nos any yeses never heard of it okay not a problem so i'm going to type the link in the chat uh let me try that again so it's literally m u r a l dot c o um don't go to that one just yet because i'm going to give you a link to my one which has all of this in there and we're going to work together on it so you can get a get a bit of a sense of it okay now let me find the link share mu visitors copy link and i'm going to put that into the zoom chat okay so once you jump in there and i'm going to share my screen as well so you can start to see okay we've now got this whiteboard so i'm just going to share my screen right now so feel free to jump in i can see a number of you are joining as the facilitators and things like that now perfect i can see some people moving around i'm going to just tweak some settings so you know we're not going to get fully distracted by by everything but you can see that we're zooming in pretty much infinitely we can also zoom out pretty much infinitely once we've got some space and you've got all of these different things here now you can let me see one moment it's fine navigation settings trackpad mode anyway so what we're going to do is we're going to essentially show you what it's going to be like and i'm going to actually work with you using the zoom chat and we're going to put some things in here just so you can get a sense of it now to do that we're going to go to the zoom chat and we're going to go to the zoom chat now to do that to do that i want to get a volunteer to put their virtual hand up and we're going to work on that idea as an entire group so essentially the reward for being the person to put your hand up is is we're going to work on that idea as a whole group and we're going to apply that to everybody so who'd like to share what your team is working on or what your theme is uh shift edge have i said that name correctly nope for this to work you're gonna have to unmute yourself and interact there you go perfect perfect hello it's good to see you yeah okay so tell me what is your idea uh actually it's more diverse like we first of all we came up the idea with the helping internal student yes in the their uh kind of honeymoon period we can call it so but like uh we just want to make it more diverse like uh even for the australian citizens when they turn adult so they need some kind of assistant and guidance to seek the like whatever they want to do for example getting the license or other things so also we include some of the online courses for for example how to deal with the menstrual cycle for the women's and other things so okay much more diverse information so sure yeah sure now what i'm gonna look at is i'm gonna do two things so the first thing that i'm gonna do and i'm gonna encourage all of you to do it so everyone who's i'm gonna invite just pause on i know it's very tempting pause on looking at the mural for now so just i can because i can see you moving your masses around just pause on that just kind of come back to zoom and like shift edge has just talked about international uh students uh you've talked about i think menstrual tracking was it you said uh and a bunch of other things yeah yeah like so diverse group of people now for all of you part of really understanding your idea is going to be starting to really understand the problem and understand the customer that is being impacted by that problem okay and it's actually a step just before mapping it out in the business model of canvas so we're gonna dive into that right now now first thing i want everyone to do is you've just heard shift ask about this now i want everyone to type in what questions do you have about the problem that shift edge is dealing with now for some of you it's like oh that's really cool it might be clear for some of you it might not be clear so either type in those questions and shift edge you're just gonna with your group capture as many of these questions as possible okay so shane says how many does it affect okay great uh what help do they already get um is it information or is it help um that or help to network to the right people like what what's actually happening in your solution um have you looked into already in place apps such as flow yep perfect now we're not going to answer any of these questions right now just yet but these are things for you to actually get clear now for everybody what i really recommend that you do as you're starting to understand your problem is actually have some conversations with people outside of your team and just share with them hey we're working on this problem and i'm going to tell you what that problem is and i want you to ask me whatever questions you've got okay just like we've done with shift edge now type in yes in the chat just type in helpful in the chat if you're like wow if i told people my problem and they just asked me all the questions they have type in helpful if you think that would be really helpful and actually getting it clear what the problem is yeah absolutely now this is going to be critical because any question that they have means that you haven't told them what that is in the first place so it's really powerful to get now some of those questions are going to be useful some of them are not going to be useful but they'll give you clarity because you might be like oh is it about this and you might like no it's actually not about that good to know now i want everyone now to have a look and what questions do you have about the users or the people experiencing this problem now shift edge hasn't told us much other than the international students and it's also mentioned um like certain things right so what questions do you have about the users or the the people being impacted by this problem to type those questions into the zoom chat type those questions what do you want to know about the people being impacted by the problem because at the moment i would say shift edge this isn't a criticism this is part of the process um your problem isn't yet clear can you get that shift edge yeah yeah you're not really clear it's fine it's just not clear at the moment are they teenagers are they adults yeah uh who shaz is really direct and really valuable hey who are you actually focusing on is it international students because that's a lot of people is it um people who need some form of menstruation tracking system because that's a also a very large group of people um yeah are they willing to share personal information about themselves what's the most challenging thing ah alvina is has a gold nugget of a question which everyone should steal by the way right everyone should steal this one what's the most challenging thing that this group experiences now why this is gold is you a lot of us in this process will immediately think that the most important thing for our group of people is what i'm working on what i'm working on or but actually asking them is going to be really powerful okay it's going to be really powerful because they might have other issues which if not addressed makes them not even worry about yours okay we're diversing we're diversifying into too many services be risky uh would you risk being a jack of all trades master of none she's got a really good point as well now what we type in the word focus if you're starting to see hey you know this focus is actually going to really help us the focus is going to really help yeah because all of these things kind of go hey you know broad is going to be difficult it's going to help i'm going to help people with legs okay now that takes out some people but like now like around the world okay like how many billion people around the world have legs okay i need to narrow that down otherwise i'm not going to help anybody yeah so focus is really critical now what i'm gonna so shifted if i were to ask you right now to pick one aspect of it and here's a way to say it this we found this group of people is experiencing this problem okay what would you say your problem that you're working on is or it might not be the one that you're working on but it's one that you've seen and you might work on it or you might not but for now what's one specific group of people and one specific problem that they're experiencing uh maybe for now for an instance we can take the international student for settling up for settling up tell me tell me what's the problem that they experience uh usually when the international like me when they arrive so they don't have much information about what to do and how to do perfect okay now all of a sudden that's a lot clearer now so hey what we found is international students when they come to their their overseas location they don't know what to do to get set up which includes bank details which includes getting a telephone which includes where to go to rent or eat food how much things cost they just don't know that stuff i type in i can type in relatable if like you're an international student or you've been overseas and you can relate to all of those things type in relatable in the zoom chat or just type in x if it's like no i don't get it yeah but for a lot of people it is relatable now so that's now a really clear problem and shift edge we're going to jump ahead a little bit now this is just for the purpose of the business model canvas now for everyone this is important you don't want to this is just to show you this the what is our solution should really come sometime next week right this week you should really focus on understanding the problem okay but shift edge and because here's the thing the moment you think of a solution now your problem becomes oh we don't have this app we actually don't know if we don't if they need the app or not like what's the actual problem first and then what's your solution but if you want to just guess something actually i want anyone in the zoom to chat to type hey what's one solution that we could give that we could create and this is going to be made up now but it's on this same international students don't know how to get set up what's one solution that we could create awesome okay facebook group anything else what's one solution a network of mentors day tour a welcome pack a university booklet okay i'm gonna just pick one for everyone um i'm gonna pick yeah okay i'm gonna pick a how to video mini welcome course okay is that clear for everyone like just like the videos that you watch for frank team uh introduction to the business model canvas okay so we're going to imagine that now in terms of customer segments i'm going to share the screen i want you to type into the zoom chat like what are some different things actually we're going to go straight to the personas what are some different aspects that are going to be really important to get to know about our customers with regard to this online uh welcome to welcome to country um video course like what are we like what types of people do you think that would really suit perhaps or and all that sort of stuff now we're going backwards a bit i'll look at that so okay can they what's their language ability really powerful hey what language do the videos need to be in yeah what are their needs where do they live uh what are their languages what are their barriers okay so now this is really powerful because we're starting to go okay you know we start to understand the customers if we start to ask these questions about our focus group we can start to go okay what does the solution actually look like okay we now we can start to see okay like a simple video might not be so simple yeah when are they coming to australia how much time um and also how long will they be staying uh what city so now we're looking at okay cool is it going to be different are some things going to be the same are some some videos we're going to need to create are they going to need to be uh more specific uh or more localized okay so and now here's one for you like are we looking at um university students specifically or just anybody coming to australia or anyone coming to live and if anybody coming to live okay so now you're starting to now it's going to get broad again right which is hard to get the focus so if you were starting to also have a look at uh students to start off with you might also want to think of are they a first year student undergrad or are they a mature age student post-grad because that age difference and that life experience will give them a completely different um set of uh experiences type type in type in yes if that makes sense that hey someone who's like fresh out of uni if they're going overseas it's going to be very different to someone who's had like five years of life experience has done some traveling um yeah absolutely so now you're solving different things so maybe if you go specific you can get closer so your customer i see the smiling face so your customer segments section you really want to nail down two or three of these groups um that you really get to know and it's not in the business model canvas but you want to start to go okay who are these people what do they need right now in terms of the value proposition we jump to this a little bit but this is something which you should really start to look at not this week next week start to look at it next week when you start the prototyping what does it actually look like why you want to start looking okay what is it actually doing we're creating this unique video service that does all this sort of stuff what does it look like and now that you've started to understand your customer maybe there's bits and pieces maybe there's content already out there maybe there's different resources maybe there's people delivering presentations what might it look like to capture all of the content that's already available and make it easily accessible what if we didn't have to create those videos from scratch or what if we could actually tap into those networks and what if we could have everyone who's part of this network they share one thing which they they liked and now you're kind of crowd sourcing it what does this look like so with your value proposition kind of probably the one of the last things to look at is what does it actually look like what is it actually what are you actually going to create and if you look here on the slide it's really it's really linked to who the customer is all right it's really linked to who the customer is because if you've got something here which doesn't fit your customers then you've you're not going to do very well okay now in terms of your channels again all linked to the customer and all linked to the problem that they're experiencing so you want to ask them hey now with this video with this video course i just want you to brainstorm in the chat like what are some ways that you might reach people or what are some challenges that you might have reaching these people so what are some ideas to reach people so what are some potential like marketing channels or communication channels to reach them or what are some challenges that you might experience go ahead and type that into the chat right now university emails yep a challenge might be blocked sites in some countries absolutely university websites challenges can be language yep so we can reach them by the university websites advertising at the university all of you know that there's a specific part of your university which deals with specifically supporting students from overseas so maybe you're working with them okay google yep targeted ads are really good for zuki fire the agent now type in if you're an international student here in australia type in agent if you actually did work with an agent as part of working out what you needed to work out to to get here into australia and start start studying here type in the word agent if you work with an agent yeah so if you start to see okay hold on a lot of these international students yeah so maybe it's the agents only for the visa yeah okay for specific things and now here's the thing right like type in yes if you know that there's just like a million different agents out there yeah there's a there's so many different agents out there dealing with specific things with specific universities and things like that so yeah great opportunity but okay hold on very disconnected interesting okay um now i want to pause for a second and i want to ask a few people just to raise your virtual hand or to type it in the chat and i want to ask you out of everything we're just starting to peel back a bit what are you starting to get about this process what are you starting to get about this process what are you starting to understand what are you starting to notice what are you starting to discover um about this whole process just type it into the chat or would actually love anyone to raise their hand and say something okay it's intricate okay so there's value in being specific to be more and more specific great start big picture and then fill in the details shazda i'd love to hear from you thank you yeah um something that i noticed is that you really need a basic understanding and you need to build on that because you don't have an understanding and you just jump through the different stages it's just going to be a mess so i guess what i really took from like um the past 10 minutes or so is that you really need to have a good understanding of your target population and then kind of work around that because ultimately that's who you're trying to help that's right yeah that's that's really right and that understanding what shazda said is so perfect right because without that understanding of your target group it's going to be impossible to make a difference like actually not going to say impossible it's going to be you're going to be as likely to make a difference as throwing a stone up in the air blindfolded and hoping it hits your target um it just so happens that the target happens to be 200 meters away so you're like you're kind of really hoping here maybe it'll hit it maybe a freak gust of wind will come and pick it on and we'll be like we'll land in the location but it's like without that understanding you're kind of cutting your your mobility off you don't have any flexibility to actually get there perfect shazda thank you tanya um i guess really identifying what the actual problem is is probably the the key thing um and focusing in and i guess part of it's going to be then you're focusing you might find that you miss the marks you have to go back again to re-identify the problem i'm sure will happen multiple times um i do have a question though on the targeting because we've gone in and out and in and out obviously understanding revenue streams which will ultimately identify whether it's a proposition and that'll work or not how do you go not too fine in scope but then all of a sudden you got to the last bit of it and you go all of a sudden that's not a viable option yeah yeah perfect so a place to start is when you look at your customer segments and this is still related to what shazda said right because it's all about understanding and what you've said about okay what's the problem now your customer segment you're going to have to work out as part of their persona what can they afford to pay what can they afford to pay now for international students some international students very wealthy some international students like living on the sniff of an oily rag kind of okay i've got to work job here job here job here so not only are they don't have like lots of cash they've like got very little time as well because they've got to work out all of this stuff really quickly okay so you've got a mix um and then you've also got okay is the customer that end user now is the customer the end user or maybe the customer is the university in this case maybe university wants to go hey we want to be the best university they're looking after international students and we're willing to pay 100 grand to have this set up they're not by the way but like what if what if i know a thing or two about university budgets yeah but like does that make sense tanya so that's gonna be part of it now if you're working with individual universities now the population size in terms of the number of universities has dropped down but you only need one or two to start really making some money and making that difference at scale okay so that's one side and then we look at the we look at the um the the revenue side i mean down in the revenue side so it's related to that as well hey this is what your customers will pay right what are they willing to pay and you can look at are there comparable services what are people paying to figure this out already another way to look at this in terms of what people might be willing to pay is how much is it costing them to not have this sorted out and if you can get that hey if you can get people to discover hey this is actually costing me 10 times what it would cost to actually get this solution a lot of people when they get clear on that and if it's an urgent need they're like yeah take my money take my money i could consider right like there was enough of this program that spoke to you that had you say you know what i am going to spend three weekends and a bunch of time during this year okay so like while this is financially free for you um in a in a specific sense you are paying for university and you're paying for all that sort of stuff but in a this particular opportunity but you are giving up your time which is in this case a form of value so a lot of you saw enough to go yep i'm in and i'm going to come to the orientation and i'm going to come to the session and i'm going to participate and all that sort of stuff there was another hand there before uh with if that if the hand comes up great um other people saying don't jump to too big an idea start with the building blocks and if i were to sum that all up which is really great the whole point which you're getting and which i'm really wanting you to get is everything that you can do to understand the customer and understand the problem is going to really help okay because if you've noticed every single bit as we go through okay here's the idea here's the value proposition what about the customer okay now we're thinking about revenue ah okay we're now going to think about the customer again we're now going to think about the problem again oh here's the this this customer component which is obviously that here's the marketing channels okay now we need to think about the customer and the problem so know that at each step that you go through yes it is going to be back being back and forth but actually you're going back and forth in a jet like forward motion if that makes sense because each thing that you do while you're constantly referring back it is pushing you forwards so this tool is is not so much a i'm going to put it down all at once it's actually a tool to kind of guide okay what do i need to think about living in this future where this is working what what does it need to look like uh shift edge you had a question uh not a question i just uh have a like oh what you got please yep yeah actually uh i got to know that like whenever it's your idea so your mindset like resist you to think out of the box so it's better to have the comment from the other people so that will help you to get the pros and cons that are more important to understand about your idea more yeah yeah absolutely and and that's so powerful right we just saw that happen before with that idea where we started asking everybody hey what are your questions about that now i want everyone to get that this is something which you can do with your ideas just tell a bunch of people and just tell them to just ask just like hey what do you what do you think what are your questions and that's that crowdsourcing gets you out of your head and into the world of reality ideally you want to be speaking to your actual customers in the absence of that you can actually crowdsource in a really powerful way kenya hi um i'm just wondering what are like exact ways to know if your problem is worthwhile solving yeah yeah what are some problems what are some ways to know if your problem is worthwhile solving here's where i would start like what's the impact on people of that problem like what's the impact and then kind of go what's the impact to every other everyone else who's involved so now if you have a look right international like let's use this as an example right we're just going to bring everything back to this example and you want to use these same questions in the same sort of way for your idea right who else is impacted okay impacted is obviously the student who's coming overseas they're lost they're confused um or they're or the opposite right they're like no i've got this like very confident and which is only a problem if they're what they are confident is what they know is actually a mismatch for what reality is and you've got potential problems yeah so what's the impact for them then you've got okay now they've got like friends family um either locally or back home now if the students stress then like parents are likely to kind of worry um so there's an impact there now if the students are stressed the university probably cares because hey like now the students aren't actually doing that or the students have a bad experience that reflects poorly reputationally on the university um sometimes through no fault to the university but like they're like yeah like i'm an international student at this university and i've had a terrible experience equals this university sucks may or may not be true but like there's an impact there okay potential impact um also the local government we've got a whole bunch of students doing all this sort of stuff if they don't know how to get to it might mean that the local businesses aren't getting the customers that they might be getting so that might be an impact now you do get more and more abstract right so it's what you do want to kind of keep in mind okay i don't know if i can actually solve all those things but it's something to keep in mind now what you look for is hey what's this focus point is there one thing that i can do that can make a massive impact across it okay and the pain point has to be sufficiently high that people like you know what i really do need to take action now if that's like i think someone else had that um had that point of let me see if i can find it it's like hey i need to oh i've lost it now um like someone else had the point of i've lost it i'm so sorry i don't remember what it was um if people someone help me out here what was i what we can you what was um first of all what are you getting from what i just said can you um i mean i'm understanding that like it's all about i guess like the severity or like the impact that not having a solution could have i think in the chat someone put to look at the cost of not being able to solve it or like what's the cost of if it's not there um and i understand that i think what i was more getting down to was just like i feel like you can make an argument for a lot of different things so it's like how do you really know if you're like targeting that one yeah yeah okay well as you go through so what i'm some this answer isn't going to be quite an answer okay but i'm going to answer it this way yeah um let me see so here's the thing as you start to look at all of these different channels like your channels your costs your revenue one of the considerations is hey is this going to be viable as in will i be able to make money and sustain it uh will it be feasible can i actually build this thing and and remember you've got like 50 50 000 to play with so that's not a lot of money um even though it might feel like it's a lot of money it's not a lot of money um and is this desirable so you want to start there when looking at your problem or your your solution ultimately so you want to start there when looking at your problem or your your solution ultimately hey do people want it can i build it
